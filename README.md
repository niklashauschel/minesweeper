## Coding Guidelines

We use PEP8. To add PEP8 to a projekt use the command Ctrl+Shift+P in vscode and click on select Linter. Choose PEP8 in the list

However, I would limit the line length to 120 characters from convenience (default for PyCharm). In VSCode this can be done with `"python.linting.pep8Args":  ["--max-line-length=120"]` can be changed. Open with CTRL+, setting.json
